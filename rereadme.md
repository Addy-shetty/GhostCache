## How it Works

Back-Me-Up works by combining the power of multiple tools to automate the bug bounty process. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

### Step 1: URL Collection

The tool uses `waybackurls` to gather URLs from internet archive data.

### Step 2: Extension Filtering

Back-Me-Up filters the URLs based on a list of juicy extensions, which are known to contain sensitive data.

### Step 3: Data Extraction

The tool uses `gau` and `gauplus` to extract data from the filtered URLs.

### Step 4: Data Analysis

Finally, Back-Me-Up analyzes the extracted data using regular expressions and patterns to discover sensitive data leakage.

## Features
